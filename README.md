# ExoVision AI â€” README

**ExoVision AI** is a hackathon-ready MVP that classifies Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) using a pre-trained LightGBM classifier and optionally fine-tunes the model in-memory with user-provided labeled data. The project pairs a polished front-end (HTML UI) with a simple Flask backend (`/api/process`) that accepts `.xlsx` uploads and returns JSON results.

This README covers: setup, usage, file formats, API contract, fine-tuning behavior, deployment notes, security, troubleshooting, and suggestions for improvement.

## What it does
- Accepts an Excel file (`.xlsx`) containing KOI observations.
- Two modes:
  - **predict**: Use a pre-trained LightGBM (`model.pkl`) to return classification probabilities and labels.
  - **retrain**: Fine-tune the LightGBM model in-memory using uploaded labeled data and return updated predictions on the provided data.
- Returns structured JSON with predictions, probabilities, and used features.
- Fine-tuned model is kept **in memory** for the running Flask process (not persisted by default).
